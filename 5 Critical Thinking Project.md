### AWS Critical Thinking Project Plan

#### **1. Project Understanding**

You are tasked with migrating two company websites to AWS while using reverse proxy technology to enhance security, scalability, performance, and cost-efficiency. The websites include:

- **E-commerce platform:** Requires stringent security, scalability, and optimal performance to handle sensitive customer data.
- **CMS:** A content management system for publishing blogs and articles, with slightly less intense security needs but still requiring high availability and resource optimization.

### **2. Solution Architecture**

#### **2.1 Reverse Proxy Technology**

- Use **AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)** as a reverse proxy, distributing incoming traffic to the backend servers securely and efficiently.
- ALB can perform SSL termination, improving security by encrypting data between clients and the load balancer. You can manage SSL certificates via **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)**.
- Implement **AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)** to inspect and filter incoming traffic, blocking malicious traffic and mitigating DDoS attacks.

#### **2.2 Scalability & Performance Optimization**

- **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)**: Use ASGs with **Amazon EC2** instances for both the e-commerce platform and the CMS. These groups will scale in response to varying traffic loads, ensuring that only the required amount of compute resources are used at any given time.
- **Caching**:
  - Implement **Amazon CloudFront** to serve static assets for both websites, caching content close to end-users to reduce latency.
  - Use CloudFront's caching mechanism to reduce the load on the backend and improve response times for end-users.

#### **2.3 Security Enhancements**

- **AWS Shield**: Protect both websites from DDoS attacks by using AWS Shield.
- **SSL Encryption**: Ensure that data between the client and load balancer is encrypted using SSL/TLS certificates.
- **IAM Roles and Policies**: Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and policies to control access to critical services and data.
- **Security Groups**: Set up security groups to control traffic flow into the EC2 instances.
- **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)**: Host databases for both websites in **private subnets** to prevent direct internet access.
- Enable **Multi-AZ (Availability Zone)** deployment for the RDS to ensure high availability and data redundancy for the e-commerce website.

#### **2.4 Cost Efficiency**

- Use **EC2 Reserved Instances** or **Savings Plans** for predictable workloads to reduce costs.
- Use **Amazon Lambda** for serverless functionality (e.g., handling certain backend tasks or processing uploads) to save on compute costs where applicable.
- Choose appropriate **instance types** for EC2 based on load analysis, balancing performance and cost.
- Utilize **Amazon S3** for storing static content (e.g., product images for the e-commerce site, media for the CMS) to avoid using EC2 instances for this purpose.

#### **2.5 High Availability**

- **Multi-AZ Deployment**: Deploy EC2 instances in multiple Availability Zones to ensure redundancy and failover in case of an AZ failure.
- Use **Elastic Load Balancer (ALB)** across multiple AZs to ensure continuous availability.
- Ensure that **Amazon RDS** for both databases (e-commerce and CMS) has automatic failover enabled through Multi-AZ configuration.

### **3. Step-by-Step Implementation**

#### **Step 1: Network Setup**

- Create a **VPC** with at least 2 public subnets and 2 private subnets (for e-commerce and CMS databases).
- Set up **Internet Gateway** for public access and **NAT Gateway** for private subnets to access the internet when necessary (e.g., for software updates).

#### **Step 2: EC2 Instances & Auto Scaling**

- Launch **EC2 instances** within the VPC to host both the e-commerce platform and CMS, with separate Auto Scaling Groups for each.
- Assign **Elastic IPs** to the EC2 instances to maintain static IP addresses.

#### **Step 3: Reverse Proxy & Load Balancing**

- Configure **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** in front of the EC2 instances to distribute traffic across them.
- Set up **SSL/TLS certificates** via AWS ACM to ensure secure communication between the clients and the ALB.
- Integrate **AWS WAF** with the ALB to add an extra layer of security by blocking malicious traffic.

#### **Step 4: Database Setup**

- For the e-commerce platform, use **Amazon RDS (MySQL/PostgreSQL)** with Multi-AZ deployment for high availability and automated backups.
- For the CMS, use **Amazon RDS** but without Multi-AZ if cost optimization is prioritized.

#### **Step 5: Caching & Performance Optimization**

- Implement **Amazon CloudFront** in front of the ALB for both websites to cache frequently accessed content and reduce latency for end-users.
- For dynamic content, ensure that caching policies are tailored to the specific needs of the e-commerce platform and CMS.

#### **Step 6: Monitoring & Management**

- Use **Amazon CloudWatch** for monitoring resource utilization, traffic patterns, and detecting potential issues.
- Set up **AWS Config** to track configuration changes and ensure compliance with security protocols.

#### **Step 7: Cost Monitoring**

- Enable **AWS Cost Explorer** to track resource usage and optimize accordingly.
- Implement **budgets and alerts** to ensure that you stay within the predefined budget for both websites.

### **4. Project Outcomes**

- **Enhanced Security**: Reverse proxy, SSL encryption, AWS WAF, and IAM policies protect both websites from external threats.
- **Scalability**: Auto Scaling Groups ensure that both websites can handle traffic surges while maintaining cost-efficiency.
- **Performance Optimization**: CloudFront and caching mechanisms reduce latency and load on backend servers.
- **High Availability**: Multi-AZ deployments and ALB across multiple AZs ensure minimal downtime.
- **Cost Efficiency**: EC2 Reserved Instances, Lambda, and S3 usage minimize costs without sacrificing performance.
